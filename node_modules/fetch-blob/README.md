A Blob implementation in Node.js, originally from [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch).

## Installation

```sh
npm install fetch-blob
```

<details>
  <summary>Upgrading from 2x to 3x</summary>

  Updating from 2 to 3 should be a breeze since there is not many changes to the blob specification.
  The major cause of a major release is coding standards.
    - internal WeakMaps was replaced with private fields
    - internal Buffer.from was replaced with TextEncoder/Decoder
    - internal buffers was replaced with Uint8Arrays
    - CommonJS was replaced with ESM
    - The node stream returned by calling `blob.stream()` was replaced with whatwg streams
    - (Read "Differences from other blobs" for more info.)

  <summary>Differences from other Blobs</summary>

  - Unlike NodeJS `buffer.Blob` (Added in: v15.7.0) and browser native Blob this polyfilled version can't be sent via PostMessage
  - This blob version is more arbitrary, it can be constructed with blob parts that isn't a instance of itself
  it has to look and behave as a blob to be accepted as a blob part.
    - The benefit of this is that you can create other types of blobs that don't contain any internal data that has to be read in other ways, such as the `BlobDataItem` created in `from.js` that wraps a file path into a blob-like item and read lazily (nodejs plans to [implement this][f
